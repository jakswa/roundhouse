# Welcome to Loco :train:

Loco is a web and API framework running on Rust.

This is the **lightweight-service starter** which comes with no database or state dependencies.

## Quick Start

1. install `bun`
2. `cargo install ultraman cargo-watch`
3. `ultraman start -f Procfile.dev`
  - this kicks of `tailwindcss` watching your templates for style changes
  - kicks off cargo-watch rebuilding your app any time you edit files

(there is no live-reloading dev experience)
